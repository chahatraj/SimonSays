In my eyes, its raining and i am in the field. I, in my brown dress, hair half loosened, half tied, a few strands flowing with the fluctuating wind. i am sitting on the cemented floor, curling my knees, my hands rested upon those. the air moves from right to left instantly and i turn my faceleft. the strands of hair stay stuck to my face and i do not put them away. i curl closer within myself with a desire of someone coming and embracing me so that the winds do not wander. i yearn for something to happen, something different than this. this idleness was not desired. this must not be happening. in my eyes, i see you coming to this field. i see you getting closer and you are standing above me now. i look upto you and smile. you see a football around and drag it near with your right leg. you wear a white t-shirt. in my eyes, i see us playing football. i see us close. my eyes on the ball and your eyes on me. in my eyes i see us together. i blink. in my eyes i see the classroom, i see you in the office room. in my eyes, i see you miles away.
